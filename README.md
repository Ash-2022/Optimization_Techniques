# Optimizationm_Techniques

This is a C++ Repo implementing the following : 
<ul>
  <li>Takes an LPP from Console </li>
  <li>Converts any LPP to standard Form </li>
  <li> Solves the LPP using Ordinary Simplex Method </li>
</ul>

# CAdditional Improvements for this repo
<ul>
  <li> Trying to add variation of Simplex like : M-Method and 2-Phase Method </li>
  <li> Optimizing the Code (Uses Brute-Force since it is a Proof of Concept) </li>
</ul>
